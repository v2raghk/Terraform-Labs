ab 4: Terraform Statefile (Remote Backend)

    Terraform statefile is like Terraform’s memory. It keeps a record of what it created, updated, or deleted in your cloud provider. 
    When you make a change, it refers to that file and compare desired state (configuration in statefile) to the actual state (Resources created in Cloud) and make changes accordingly.

Step 1 Create Storage Account

    Statefile is saved in a storage account. So we will create a storage account and save tfstate in storage blob.
    Create a storage account named tfstateprod1234567
 
 Step 2 Create Blob Container

    Create a container named tfstate with public access level: Private (no anonymous access).
 
Step 3 Terraform code for Backend

    We need to add the details of remote backend storage account in terraform code. This will tell terraform to use the storage account for tfstatefile. 
    Add this code in main.tf:


      terraform {
        backend "azurerm" {
          resource_group_name   = "terraform-rg"
          storage_account_name  = "tfstateprod1234567" 
          container_name        = "tfstate"
          key                   = "terraform.tfstate"
        }
      }
      
    This block tells Terraform: “Store my state file in this Azure blob.”

Step 4
 
    Run terraform plan. Check if all looks good. Run terraform apply to create statefile in Azure.
     
Tips for Terraform Statefile 

      Don’t Store State Locally (in Production). Local state (terraform.tfstate) is fine for experiments or learning, but risky in team or cloud infrastructure projects.
      
      Azure => azurerm
      AWS => s3
      GCP → gcs
      
      Use terraform state Commands Carefully. Below commands modify the state file manually — useful in emergencies but risky:

      terraform state list	See all tracked resources
      terraform state show <resource>	Inspect a specific resource
      terraform state rm <resource>	Remove resource from state (without destroying it)
      terraform state mv <old> <new>	Move or rename a resource in state

      Backup the State File Before Any Risky Action
      Always back up this file
      
      
      cp terraform.tfstate terraform.tfstate.backup
