terraform graph

This is a tool that generates a visual representation of Terraform resources and their dependencies. 
Itâ€™s especially useful for understanding how resources are connected and the order in which Terraform will create or destroy them.

# terraform graph
Outputs a graph in DOT format (used by Graphviz).
This is a textual representation of the resource dependency graph.

We can open the file in notepad but it will be in text format.

To view the graphical representation, we can download a tool named graphviz and view the graphical representation of terraform infrastructure.

Save graph to a file

# terraform graph > graph.dot

This saves the graph in DOT format for further visualization.
