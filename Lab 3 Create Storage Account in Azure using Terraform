Lab 3: Create an Azure Storage Account using Terraform

Overview

        This tutorial will show the details about creating an Azure Storage Account using Terraform.

Prerequisites

        #	Terraform installed
        #	Azure CLI installed
        #	Azure account with sufficient permissions (e.g., Contributor)
        #	Authenticated to Azure using Service Principal or az login

Step 1: Create a Folder

        Create a folder named “azure storage” on C drive on your laptop. We will be using a Windows laptop for this lab.

Step 2: Create Terraform Config File

        Under the folder, create a file named main.tf with the following terraform code:
        
        provider "azurerm" {
          features {}
        }
        
        resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
          name     = "rg-storage-demo"
          location = "West Europe"
        }
        
        resource "azurerm_storage_account" "storage" {
          name                     = "storagedemo1234" # Give a unique name globally
          resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
          location                 = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
          account_tier             = "Standard"
          account_replication_type = "LRS"
        
          tags = {
            environment = "demo"
          }
        }

Step 3: Initialize Terraform

        Open command prompt and go to C:/azure storage and run the following command:
        
        # terraform init

Step 4: Preview the Plan

        Next, run the following command from command prompt:
        
        # terraform plan

Step 5: Apply Terraform Config

        Next, run the following command from command prompt: 
        
        # terraform apply
        
        Type yes when prompted.

Step 6: Verify in Azure Portal

        Go to https://portal.azure.com. Navigate to Resource Groups => rg-storage-demo
        We will see Storage Account storagedemo1234 in Azure.

Step 7: Clean Up Resources (Optional)

        If you are in the testing environment, delete your resources to prevent any charges in Azure by running the command below:
    
        # terraform destroy

Notes

          #	Storage account name must be globally unique and all lowercase (3–24 characters).
          #	account_tier: Options are Standard or Premium.
          #	account_replication_type: Common options include LRS, GRS, etc.
