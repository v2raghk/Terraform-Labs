🌱 Terraform Beginners Labs

Welcome to Terraform Beginners Labs repository! 

A structured set of hands-on labs for learning Terraform and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). These labs are organized to help beginners understand Terraform concepts and build practical cloud infrastructure skills step by step.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

Terraform-Labs/
├── Beginners Labs/
│   ├── Lab 01
│   ├── Lab 02
│   ├── Lab 03
and so on.

Each lab is designed to gradually increase in complexity. You can work through them sequentially to steadily build your Terraform skills and expertise.

📘 What You'll Learn

Through these labs, you'll gain practical experience in:

Terraform Basics: Understanding the core concepts and syntax of HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).
Infrastructure Provisioning: Automating the deployment of cloud resources such as compute instances, storage, and networking components.
State Management: Learning how Terraform manages infrastructure state and how to handle state files securely.
Modules and Reusability: Structuring your Terraform code for scalability and maintainability using modules.
Version Control Integration: Integrating Terraform with Git for version-controlled infrastructure management.
